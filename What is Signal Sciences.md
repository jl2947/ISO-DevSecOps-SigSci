# Brief overview of Signal Sciences

Signal Sciences is a web protection platform that Turner has procured to help give us visibility and protection against common web application attacks. This flexible platform allows us to deploy it into any application stack while integrating your current workflows and operations processes with DevOps methodology. It supports any language, cloud, and physical infrastructure. The platform is able to intelligently and automatically adapt its cloud analysis engine in real time and simultaneously report the results to a dashboard without disruption to services. 

This platform provides protection against: 

+ *Application Abuse*
+ *Application DDoS*
+ *Account Takeover*
+ *Attack Tooling* 
+ *Bots*
+ *Business Logic Attacks*
+ *OWASP Top 10*


## Signal Sciences consists of three main products.

** *Next-Generation Web Application Firewall (NGWAF)* ** 

NGWAF module embeds directly into the web server instance. Easy to install into web application servers such as NGINX, Apache, IIS, etc. Uses a safe, fail-open architecture to communicate with the Signal Sciences local agent, which creates a fast, reliable, and secure asynchronous connection to the Signal Sciences cloud decision engine to ensure your customer traffic is stable and scalable.

**Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP)** 

RASP module embeds directly into the application source code. It doesn't require any SDK-based application rewrites and simply drops into your application code as a library and provides protection through security controls at the source code layer. Supports the most frequently used languages such as .NET, Javaa, and NodeJS. Does not require modification or hack of your infrastructure, underlying system, virtual machines, debug compilations of code, or changes to the Java Virtual Machine or .NET CLR. Simply update your code with a single library to have security embedded.

**Reverse Proxy**

Reverse Proxy module can be deployed in front of the web server to avoid modifying legacy-based server or source code components. It provides infinite scalability and security without having to touch the source code or web server configuration itself. This provides security at the load balancer or proxy layer. Makes the most sense when architecture necessitates this solution or third-party applications are being used, and will also protect any web servers downstream.
